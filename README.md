this malware can invert  your screen make message boxes and also do way more stuff move around your mouse, open up random websites, and a bit more i forgot so yeah
and also this is inspired by batch and vbs garbage stuff on youtube check it out at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGlffYif3Mg
and yeah basically its inspired by that video and you can mess with it idc so also yeah this is not destructive but it might be bad
and as you can see it was powershell and batch too because it wouldn't work for the message boxes so shoutout to powershell
